# Documentation Portal

This folder centralizes all project knowledge for the OpenAI Agent SDK runtime. It is grouped into four collections:

1. `overview/` – architecture, code structure, policy-as-code, and system context.
2. `guides/` – deep-dive tutorials and conceptual references (e.g., the SDK Guide, tool execution demo).
3. `runbooks/` – operator procedures for lifecycle management, logging, checkpoint recovery, network/MCP diagnostics.
4. `reports/` – verification artifacts (gap analysis, GA readiness, release checklist, compatibility matrix, SLO/test evidence).

Use this index alongside `SpecSheet.md` and `AGENTS.md` to keep implementation and operational decisions aligned.
